This configuration code is taken from Dreams Of Code youtube channel and all I did is just merge the C++ and Rust config in one folder and Rust and Go config in the other folder here is the link to his Youtube Channel :- http://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofcode




This is his neovim rust setup video :- https://youtu.be/mh_EJhH49Ms?si=RDrm_yKgpmSmhs1f




This is the neovim go setup video :- https://youtu.be/i04sSQjd-qo?si=oxisysEXOV-mMR5w




This is the neovim c++ setup video :- https://youtu.be/lsFoZIg-oDs?si=A9vQGAp8dU_IJQLj




So if you are using only C++ and Rust then download or copy the Rust_CPP config and if you are using only Rust and Go then download or copy the code from Rust_Go
